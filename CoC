Code of Conduct

Because trans and non-binary people already experience unique forms of discrimination, it is important to us that our event be not only safe and harassment free, but a positive and affirming space for everyone involved.

We honor all gender identities, races, sexualities, body types, economic backgrounds, abilities, religious beliefs and overall ways of human being, as we believe that diversity of experiences is key to successful collaborations.

All Trans*Code participants, volunteers, mentors, speakers, and team members are expected to follow this code of conduct throughout Trans*Code events and in all Trans*Code virtual spaces. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the conference organizers.
